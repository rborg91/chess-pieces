# chess-pieces

Use this repo to obtain attributes on all of the pieces used in chess.

## How to use

Simply run `python main.py` in your terminal

This will return all of the pieces used in chess, as well as the following attributes:

- Number of spaces that can be moved
- Direction of movement
- Shape of movement
- Number of pieces on the board for the specific piece

## Future plans

Planning to add arguments to `main.py`

e.g. `python main.py --bishop --direction` will return the direction of movement
for bishop
